Stress Detection with Machine Learning

Description-Stress detection using machine learning involves the development of a system that can detect an individual's level of stress based on various physiological and behavioral data inputs. This can be accomplished by collecting data from sources such as heart rate, skin conductance, facial expressions, and speech patterns. The data is then processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns that are indicative of stress. The output of the system is a stress score or level that can be used to provide real-time feedback to the individual.

                 The dataset Iâ€™m utilizing for this project contains information presented on subreddits related 
                 on emotional wellness. This dataset contains different emotional well-being issues shared by 
                 individuals or One word Conversion of two or more individual being,about their life.

                 People often share their feelings on social media platforms. Many organizations can use those post for
                 stress detection to find which social media users are in stressed or not and help them quickly. 
                 
                 
                 The Steps we follow to get Correct Results are-
                 1)Data Collection,2)Data Preprocesing,3)Feature Engineering,4)Model Selection,
                 5)Training the Model,6)Evaluating the Model,7)Parameter Tuning,8)Making Predictions
                 
                 It is also important to note that creating a successful machine learning project requires a good understanding 
                 of both the domain and the algorithms being used.

Advantage: This type of system has potential applications in fields such as mental health, wellness, and human-computer interaction.
